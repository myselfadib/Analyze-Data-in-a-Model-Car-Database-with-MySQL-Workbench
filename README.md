# Analyze-Data-in-a-Model-Car-Database-with-MySQL-Workbench
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for a comprehensive inventory management analysis aimed at optimizing warehouse operations. The dataset includes information about products, their stock levels, sales, and storage across multiple warehouses. The primary goal is to identify inefficiencies in inventory distribution and recommend actionable insights for improving business processes.

Key Features:
Data Exploration:

Detailed SQL queries analyze product sales, stock levels, and the distribution across multiple warehouses.
Calculation of summary statistics to provide a clear understanding of current inventory status.
Warehouse Optimization:

Analysis of warehouse capacity and inventory levels to determine if consolidation is possible.
Identification of underutilized warehouses, leading to recommendations such as closing the South warehouse to reduce costs.
Stock and Sales Analysis:

Identified overstocked products with low sales, allowing for better inventory management decisions.
Evaluation of products that have never been sold but are still in stock.
Consolidation Strategy:

Calculation of full warehouse capacity based on current usage.
Simulated transfer of stock from one warehouse to another to optimize space utilization.
Technologies Used:
SQL (MySQL)
Data-driven business insights
Inventory and warehouse management strategies
This project highlights practical applications of SQL in data analysis and decision-making, particularly in the realm of inventory management and warehouse optimization.
